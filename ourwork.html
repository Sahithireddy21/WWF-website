    <p>People depend on the natural world—its forests, fisheries and wildlife—for their ways of life. Conserving species, protecting habitats, and keeping our climate and environment healthy is good for all of us.</p><br><br>
    <p>We has long understood that the people who live in the places we work are critical leaders in conservation. Over time, our work with people has supported community efforts and led to transformative social and environmental results. This is a socially inclusive conservation approach. Together, we find practical and beneficial ways for both people and nature to thrive.</p><br>

        <p1>For its entire history, We has joined a group of conservation organizations at the forefront of efforts to incorporate human rights and needs into our work. The most important inhabitants of any forest, river basin, or seascape are its people, and the policies We has embraced are central to making sure that all people have access and opportunity to better their lives in the places that we work.</p1>
